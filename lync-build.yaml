# Lync Build Configuration
# Determines how the Lync compiler will assemble and output your Markdown modules.

# The entry files to compile
includes:
  - "**/*.lync.md"

# The output destination directory
output:
  # dir: "./dist"
  # flat: true # Uncomment to ignore baseDir hierarchy and compile everything directly into dir
  inPlace: true # Uncomment to compile files directly alongside their source (e.g., a/prompt.lync.md -> a/prompt.md)

# Strip this prefix directory from the original paths
baseDir: "."

# Target languages for multi-language generation (optional)
# By default, Lync infers languages automatically from :::lang=xxx blocks in your source.
# Uncomment below to force explicit language generation for all matched files:
# targetLangs:
#  - "en"
#  - "zh-CN"

# Advanced Routing Interceptors (optional)
# routing:
#   - match: "src/agents/*.lync.md"
#     dest: "./dist/agents/"
